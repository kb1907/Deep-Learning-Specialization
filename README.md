### WHAT  I LEARN

- Build and train deep neural networks, identify key architecture parameters, implement vectorized neural networks and deep learning to applications

- Train test sets, analyze variance for DL applications, use standard techniques and optimization algorithms, and build neural networks in TensorFlow

- Build a CNN and apply it to detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply algorithms to image and video data

- Build and train RNNs, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to perform NER and Question Answering



- In this folder, [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) projects and notes can be found.


- **DeepLearning.AI** makes these slides available for educational purposes.
