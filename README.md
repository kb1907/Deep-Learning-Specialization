### There are 5 Courses in this Specialization
--------------------------------------------------

## [Course 1 Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/kb1907/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)

- [In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning), I study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 

- By the end,  I am familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to my own applications.
